# SURF'S UP

## Overview

The obejective of this analysis is to determine whether its a good idea to open an Ice cream/Surfboard rental shop in Hawaii. Narrowing it down, we are discussing Oahu in specific. To determine this, I analyzed the weather during one month in the summer and one month in the winter. The data extraction was done using SQLAlchemy.

## Results
### June
